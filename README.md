# minishell (95 / 100)

# Introduction
This project is all about recreating your very own (mini)shell, taking bash (Bourne Again SHell) as reference.

As we just said, we are asked to implement our own shell, but what is a shell to begin with? If we think of (for example) Linux as a nut or a seashell, the kernel/seed is the core of the nut and has to be surrounded by a cover or shell. Likewise, the shell we are implementing works as a command interpreter communicating with the OS kernel in a secure way, and allows us to perform a number tasks from a command line, namely execute commands, create or delete files or directories, or read and write content of files, among (many) other things
